# Loan-Data-ETL-and-Preprocessing-Pipeline
Developed a robust ETL pipeline to preprocess a loan dataset for financial analysis, using Python and NumPy. 
The project involved extracting raw data from a CSV file, performing extensive data cleaning and transformation, and loading the processed dataset into a structured format suitable for downstream analytics. 
Key tasks included handling missing values, standardizing string and numeric columns and converting categorical data into numerical formats.
The dataset was sorted and exported as a clean, analysis-ready CSV file.
